#  Explore London 💂🏼

**"Explore" is my first ever app written using SwiftUI (after only ever using Storyboards & UIKit), and is meant to be pure practice. With this project, I discover best Swift practices, learn the SwiftUI workflow, and get to know the iOS app development cycle! It is not meant to be an amazing app ready to be shipped in the App Store :)**

## What is this all about?

All source files are located in the [`Explore`](https://github.com/PiotrRut/Explore-London/tree/main/Explore) folder.

The idea here is simple - the app uses a static set of information about several tourist attractions in London, all fed to it from the `locations.json` file. This data is then passed over to a list and location detail view respectively, with the latter being the main view user land on to view information about a given landmark. The information is rendered in a nice looking design, which looks very iOS-like. Each location view also has a "Directions" button which redirects the user to the Apple Maps app.

There is also a map view where users can see all locations displayed on a map.

There will be more functions, screens and nice things coming as I explore SwiftUI and learn more!

## Build instructions 📲

If you have an iPhone, iPod touch or an iPad, you can connect it directly to your Mac and run this app locally. To do that, select your device as the build target in Xcode and run using `⌘ + R`.

Alternatively, run it inside an Xcode simulator by choosing one of the available devices as your build target.
