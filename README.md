#  Explore London üíÇüèº

**"Explore" is my first ever app written using SwiftUI (after only ever usign Storyboards and UIKit), and is meant to be pure practice. With this app, I discover best Swift practics, learnt he SwiftUI workflow, and get to know the iOS app development cycle! It is not meant to be a breakthrough amazing app ready to be shipped in the App Store :)**

## What is it all about?

All source files are located in the [`Explore`](https://github.com/PiotrRut/Explore-London/tree/main/Explore) folder.

The idea here is simple - the app uses a static set of information about several tourist attractions in London, all fed to it from the `locations.json` file. This data is then passed over to a list and location detail view respectively, with the latter being the main view user land on to view information about a given landmark. The information is rendered in a nice looking design, which looks very iOS-like. Each location view also has a "Directions" button which redirects the user to the Apple Maps app.

There will be more functions, screens and nice things coming as I explore SwiftUI and learn more!
